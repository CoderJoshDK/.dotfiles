# Joshie's dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. Powered by [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html#).

This setup _only_ work on MacOS. On a fresh machine, invoke git. That will prompt you to
install xcode. From there you can git install this repo <https://github.com/CoderJoshDK/.dotfiles.git>.

Then run `./install.sh`. It will setup homebrew and all other software I use on all my machines.
A few other pieces of software are currently not downloaded. Like slack (I don't want that
on my personal machine.)

Some software also requires their own setup and config through the GUI // Application. But
this repo should take you most of the way to ready to program.
